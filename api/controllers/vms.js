/*
 Modules make it possible to import JavaScript files into your application.  Modules are imported
 using 'require' statements that give you a reference to the module.

  It is a good idea to list the modules that your application depends on in the package.json in the project root
 */
/*
 Once you 'require' a module you can reference the things that it exports.  These are defined in module.exports.

 For a controller in a127 (which this is) you should export the functions referenced in your Swagger document by name.

 Either:
  - The HTTP Verb of the corresponding operation (get, put, post, delete, etc)
  - Or the operationId associated with the operation in your Swagger document

  In the starter/skeleton project the 'get' operation on the '/hello' path has an operationId named 'hello'.  Here,
  we specify that in the exports of this module that 'hello' maps to the function named 'hello'
 */
module.exports = {
  // a127 controller
  vm: vm_a127
};

const vm = (req, res) => {
  var name = req.swagger.params.name.value || "stranger";
  res.json({ ok: "" });
};
